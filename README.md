# timer_project
 
It's my first personal project that I just thought to make. It's !! the timer. I made this to study by myself. it would contain a start button and an end button and "happy" that is my dog button which screens out some sentences to cheer me up. and time will always be shown. I can't spend all my time doing this cause I was not graduated yet but I just do it.
